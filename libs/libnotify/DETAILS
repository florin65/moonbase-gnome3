cat << EOF
The Desktop Notifications framework provides a standard way of doing passive
pop-up notifications on the Linux desktop. These are designed to notify the
user of something without interrupting their work with a dialog box that they
must close. Passive popups can automatically disappear after a short period of
time. This project consists of a specification and implementation (libnotify
and notification-daemon).
